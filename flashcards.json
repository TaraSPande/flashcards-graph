As we continually lower the threshold, TPR will increase closer to 100% (because FN is decreasing), but FPR will also increases (TN will decrease)! The model is classifying well if TPR is high and FPR is low, particularly for those higher thresholds like >0.9 (farther left points on graph). Example: If we have high FPR at >0.9, then the model is super confident that a negative should be positive -> which is bad. It represents the trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity of a classifier. REMEMBER: TPR and FPR are separate and not dependent on each other!!! (both can and do increase at the same time depending on the threshold). TPR = how many positives guess correctly at X threshold? FPR = how many negatives guessed wrong at X threshold?
